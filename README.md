# Particle Life
Particle life is a particle simulation showcasing a concept known as emergent behavior.
Emergent behavior can be described as when complex patterns emerge from seamingly simple rules, and particle life is a great example of this.

# Requirements
Now supports windows due to changing a terminal based uiusing termion to a macroquad immediate mode ui.

# Try it
To try it you can follow the install instructions below.
Or got to https://tagedan.github.io/particle_life/ (Note that the web version is slower, I recommend no more than 5000 or maybe 6000 particles)

# Installation
Clone this project into your directory of choice and then in that directory run 
```cargo build --release```
and then you can find your binary as
```./target/release/particle_life```
